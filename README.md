## [Description](#table-of-contents)
This project is a README generator utilizing node.js, npm packages, and javascript. The project takes user inputs and generates a README for the user without the user having to input markdown syntax. Creating README's and using .md syntax is another language that some developers may not want to learn, this project is a way around that issue.
## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
To install, either clone the repository or download it as a zip file. Once on your computer, open the file in a code-editor, then open the code-editor's integrated terminal. Once there, you will be able to activate the project.
## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
After installation, you can run: "node index.js" in the terminal. Answer the prompted questions and afterwards a new .md file will be created with your inputs.
